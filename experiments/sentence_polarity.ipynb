film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . \\n\",\"the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . \\n\",\"cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient

ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . \\n\",\"even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . \\n\",\"building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . \\n\",\"neither the funniest film that eddie murphy

\\n\",\"smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . \\n\",\"a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . \\n\",\"salma goes native and

, glaring and unforgettable . \\n\",\"director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the \\\" miami vice \\\" checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . \\n\",\"this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . \\n\",\"[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . \\n\",\"if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . \\n\",\"try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . \\n\",\"presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . \\n\",\"an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy . \\n\",\"nothing more than a mediocre trifle . \\n\",\"you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . \\n\",\"becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . \\n\",\"the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . \\n\",\"to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . \\n\",\"if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . \\n\",\"it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . \\n\",\"contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . \\n\",\"handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . \\n\",\"others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . \\n\",\"too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . \\n\",\"although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey\\n\",\"with its hints of a greater

mechanical and joyless . \\n\",\"if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . \\n\",\"the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who

film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . \\n\",\"most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . \\n\",\"grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . \\n\",\"the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de

relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . \\n\",\"dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . \\n\",\"a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival . \\n\",\" . . . could easily be called the best

fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . \\n\",\"the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking

the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . \\n\",\"this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in

minimum requirement of disney animation . \\n\",\"well-meaning but inert . \\n\",\"overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , (

realities of middle age . \\n\",\"coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . \\n\",\"a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . \\n\",\"at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . \\n\",\"the movie bounces all over the map . \\n\",\"as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . \\n\",\"by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not

half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . \\n\",\"though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . \\n\",\"one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . \\n\",\"saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . \\n\",\"it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . \\n\",\"it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . \\n\",\"[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . \\n\",\"predictably melodramatic . \\n\",\"this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . \\n\",\"i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . \\n\",\"satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . \\n\",\"the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . \\n\",\"on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . \\n\",\"the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . \\n\",\"full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . \\n\",\"there may have been a good film in \\\" trouble every day , \\\" but it is not what is on the screen . \\n\",\"while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . \\n\",\"one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . \\n\",\"the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . \\n\",\"the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . \\n\",\"it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . \\n\",\"mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . \\n\",\"all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . \\n\",\"this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . \\n\",\"lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . \\n\",\" . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . \\n\",\"russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . \\n\",\"the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . \\n\",\"enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . \\n\",\"thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . \\n\",\"its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . \\n\",\"in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . \\n\",\"an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . \\n\",\"sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . \\n\",\"richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . \\n\",\"one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . \\n\",\"halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . \\n\",\"this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . \\n\",\"the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . \\n\",\"it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . \\n\",\"the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . \\n\",\"show me the mugging . \\n\",\"i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . \\n\",\"it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . \\n\",\"dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver . \\n\",\"in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . \\n\",\"it is a likable story , told with competence . \\n\",\"what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . \\n\",\"chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . \\n\",\"one lousy movie . \\n\",\" . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . \\n\",\"i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . \\n\",\"an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . \\n\",\"a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . \\n\",\"no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . \\n\",\"the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . \\n\",\"a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . \\n\",\"never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . \\n\",\"high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . \\n\",\"you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . \\n\",\"an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . \\n\",\"wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . \\n\",\"his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . \\n\",\"one of the worst films of 2002 . \\n\",\"insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . \\n\",\"paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . \\n\",\"impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . \\n\",\"audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . \\n\",\"the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . \\n\",\"[kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . \\n\",\"the talents of the actors helps \\\" moonlight mile \\\" rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . \\n\",\"an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . \\n\",\"a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . \\n\",\"what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts . \\n\",\"a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . \\n\",\"this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . \\n\",\"it's just not very smart . \\n\",\"put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . \\n\",\"often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . \\n\",\"city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . \\n\",\"the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . \\n\",\"kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . \\n\",\"this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . \\n\",\"the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . \\n\",\"the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . \\n\",\"should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . \\n\",\"it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . \\n\",\"unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . \\n\",\"oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . \\n\",\"if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . \\n\",\"kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . \\n\",\"i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . \\n\",\"several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . \\n\",\"lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . \\n\",\"any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . \\n\",\"to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . \\n\",\"i simply can't recommend it enough . \\n\",\"a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . \\n\",\"a wonderful , ghastly film . \\n\",\"putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . \\n\",\"a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . \\n\",\"faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , \\\" a walk to remember \\\" succeeds through sincerity . \\n\",\"a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . \\n\",\"morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . \\n\",\"a gem of a movie . \\n\",\"the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . \\n\",\"this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . \\n\",\"berry's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making \\\" die another day \\\" one of the most entertaining bonds in years\\n\",\"it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . \\n\",\"mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . \\n\",\"murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . \\n\",\"ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . \\n\",\"it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . \\n\",\"who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . \\n\",\"monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . \\n\",\"both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . \\n\",\"distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . \\n\",\"in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . \\n\",\"skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . \\n\",\"like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . \\n\",\"if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . \\n\",\"every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . \\n\",\"disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . \\n\",\"a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . \\n\",\"what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . \\n\",\"there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin\\n\",\"more maudlin than sharp . \\n\",\"jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . \\n\",\"it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . \\n\",\"the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . \\n\",\"though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . \\n\",\"those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . \\n\",\"humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . \\n\",\"the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . \\n\",\"gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . \\n\",\"below is well below expectations . \\n\",\"even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . \\n\",\"no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . \\n\",\"i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . \\n\",\"the film is strictly routine . \\n\",\"you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . \\n\",\"beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . \\n\",\"get out your pooper-scoopers . \\n\",\"this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . \\n\",\"a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . \\n\",\"a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . \\n\",\"so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . \\n\",\"[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . \\n\",\"they should have called it gutterball . \\n\",\"shallow , noisy and pretentious . \\n\",\"burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . \\n\",\"there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . \\n\",\"with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . \\n\",\"a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . \\n\",\"barely gets off the ground . \\n\",\" . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . \\n\",\"though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . \\n\",\"in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 loaded with credits like \\\" girl in bar #3 . \\\" \\n\",\"a negligible british comedy . \\n\",\"adam sandler ! in an art film ! \\n\",\"calculated swill . \\n\",\"not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . \\n\",\"abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . \\n\",\"a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . \\n\",\"if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . \\n\",\"it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . \\n\",\"anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . \\n\",\"sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . \\n\",\"a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . \\n\",\"exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming . \\n\",\"jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . \\n\",\"windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . \\n\",\"credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . \\n\",\"worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . \\n\",\"i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . \\n\",\"birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . \\n\",\"manages to delight without much of a story . \\n\",\"a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . \\n\",\"parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into bu\\u00f1uel's casings\\n\",\"the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . \\n\",\"poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . \\n\",\"standing by yourself is haunting . . . [it's] what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . \\n\",\"the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . \\n\",\"the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . \\n\",\" . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . \\n\",\"the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . \\n\",\"reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . \\n\",\"it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . \\n\",\"definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . \\n\",\" . . . a guiltless film for nice evening out . \\n\",\"everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . \\n\",\"this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . \\n\",\"feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . \\n\",\"a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . \\n\",\"final verdict : you've seen it all before . \\n\",\"u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts . \\n\",\"the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . \\n\",\" . . . post-september 11 , \\\" the sum of all fears \\\" seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . \\n\",\"tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . \\n\",\"the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . \\n\",\"given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . \\n\",\"a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . \\n\",\"very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . \\n\",\"i've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . \\n\",\"enticing and often funny documentary . \\n\",\"the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . \\n\",\"it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . \\n\",\"with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . \\n\",\"expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women . \\n\",\"a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . \\n\",\"discursive but oddly riveting documentary . \\n\",\"an impressive hybrid . \\n\",\"maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad . \\n\",\"liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . \\n\",\"[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . \\n\",\"highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . \\n\",\"it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . \\n\",\"despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . \\n\",\"for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . \\n\",\"a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . \\n\",\"directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name\\n\",\"a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . \\n\",\"an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . \\n\",\"tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple \\u0097 he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . \\n\",\"cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . \\n\",\"has all the depth of a wading pool . \\n\",\"an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . \\n\",\"the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . \\n\",\"a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . \\n\",\"too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . \\n\",\"halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . \\n\",\"several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . \\n\",\"the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . \\n\",\"the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . \\n\",\"frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . \\n\",\"[i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . \\n\",\"talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . \\n\",\"the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . \\n\",\" \\\" mr . deeds \\\" is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . \\n\",\"a puzzling experience . \\n\",\"eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . \\n\",\"comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . \\n\",\"[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . \\n\",\"in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . \\n\",\"solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . \\n\",\"clever but not especially compelling . \\n\",\" \\\" white oleander , \\\" the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material . \\n\",\"crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . \\n\",\"some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since \\\" saving private ryan \\\" have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . \\n\",\"what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than \\\" bladerunner \\\" and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . \\n\",\"this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . \\n\",\"a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . \\n\",\"it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . \\n\",\"not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . \\n\",\"even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking\\n\",\"a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . \\n\",\"you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . \\n\",\"bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . \\n\",\"fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . \\n\",\"an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . \\n\",\"a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . \\n\",\"this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? \\n\",\"despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . \\n\",\"as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . \\n\",\"the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . \\n\",\"a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . \\n\",\"rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . \\n\",\" . . . an interesting slice of history . \\n\",\"on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . \\n\",\"beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . \\n\",\"blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . \\n\",\"does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . \\n\",\"all in all , a great party . \\n\",\"it's stylishly directed with verve . . . \\n\",\"no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . \\n\",\" . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . \\n\",\"despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . \\n\",\"some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . \\n\",\"a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . \\n\",\"great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . \\n\",\"the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . \\n\",\"fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . \\n\",\"it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . \\n\",\"the movie is well done , but slow . \\n\",\"like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . \\n\",\"a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . \\n\",\" . . . an inviting piece of film . \\n\",\"the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . \\n\",\"at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . \\n\",\"you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards . \\n\",\"i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . \\n\",\"the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . \\n\",\"billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . \\n\",\"the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . \\n\",\" \\\" antwone fisher \\\" is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . \\n\",\"a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . \\n\",\"a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . \\n\",\"it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . \\n\",\"a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . \\n\",\"a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . \\n\",\"there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy . \\n\",\"davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . \\n\",\"the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . \\n\",\"it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . \\n\",\"the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . \\n\",\"the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . \\n\",\"visually captivating . \\n\",\"a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the \\\" a \\\" range , as is , it's a very very strong \\\" b+ . \\\" i love the robust middle of this picture . \\n\",\"apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . \\n\",\"works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . \\n\",\"an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . \\n\",\"the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . \\n\",\"kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . \\n\",\"overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . \\n\",\" \\\" not really as bad as you might think ! \\\" \\n\",\"jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . \\n\",\"it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . \\n\",\"droll caper-comedy remake of \\\" big deal on madonna street \\\" that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate \\\" bellini \\\" begins to look like a \\\" real kaputschnik . \\\" \\n\",\"maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . \\n\",\"'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '\\n\",\"seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . \\n\",\"the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . \\n\",\"the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . \\n\",\"a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . \\n\",\"swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . \\n\",\"long time dead ? not nearly long enough . \\n\",\"by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . \\n\",\"makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . \\n\",\"every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . \\n\",\"i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . \\n\",\"stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's \\\" waking up in reno . \\\" go back to sleep . \\n\",\"it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . \\n\",\"falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . \\n\",\"a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . \\n\",\"there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . \\n\",\"with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . \\n\",\"a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . \\n\",\"throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . \\n\",\"a three-hour cinema master class . \\n\",\"an enjoyable experience . \\n\",\"suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . \\n\",\"the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . \\n\",\"the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . \\n\",\"a film of quiet power . \\n\",\"an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . \\n\",\"morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . \\n\",\"these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . \\n\",\"it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . \\n\",\"a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . \\n\",\"after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . \\n\",\"a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . \\n\",\"skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . \\n\",\"though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . \\n\",\"the movie is a mess from start to finish . \\n\",\"i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . \\n\",\"given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . \\n\",\"bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . \\n\",\"no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . \\n\",\"before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . \\n\",\"when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . \\n\",\"literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . \\n\",\"a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . \\n\",\" \\\" spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . \\\" \\n\",\"birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . \\n\",\"has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . \\n\",\"boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . \\n\",\"although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . \\n\",\"the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting . \\n\",\"the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . \\n\",\"troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . \\n\",\"the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . \\n\",\"an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . \\n\",\"it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . \\n\",\" . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor \\u0097 but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . \\n\",\"what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . \\n\",\"it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . \\n\",\"the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . \\n\",\"between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . \\n\",\"stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . \\n\",\"desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . \\n\",\"a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . \\n\",\"like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . \\n\",\"my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . \\n\",\" . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . \\n\",\"what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . \\n\",\"it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . \\n\",\"it's a very valuable film . . . \\n\",\"be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . \\n\",\"a mess , but it's a sincere mess . \\n\",\"mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . \\n\",\"some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . \\n\",\"a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . \\n\",\"the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . \\n\",\"denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . \\n\",\"like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . \\n\",\"it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . \\n\",\"if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . \\n\",\"a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . \\n\",\"buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich\\u00e9s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . \\n\",\"none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with \\\" xxx \\\" is that its own action isn't very effective . \\n\",\"it's just rather leaden and dull . \\n\",\"not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . \\n\",\"evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . \\n\",\"it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -\\u0096 audience sadism -- is evaded completely . \\n\",\"in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . \\n\",\"funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . \\n\",\"it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . \\n\",\"perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . \\n\",\"it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons \\u0096 a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . \\n\",\"charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . \\n\",\"with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . \\n\",\"with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of \\\" his girl friday , \\\" maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . \\n\",\"a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . \\n\",\"has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . \\n\",\"how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . \\n\",\" \\\" home movie \\\" is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . \\n\",\"the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . \\n\",\"make like the title and dodge this one . \\n\",\"a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . \\n\",\" . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clich\\u00e9s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . \\n\",\"this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . \\n\",\"affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . \\n\",\"for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . \\n\",\"it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . \\n\",\"there are moments of hilarity to be had . \\n\",\"mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . \\n\",\"a potent allegorical love story . \\n\",\" . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . \\n\",\"the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . \\n\",\"somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . \\n\",\"the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . \\n\",\"a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . \\n\",\"tailored to entertain ! \\n\",\"only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . \\n\",\"whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . \\n\",\"provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . \\n\",\"a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . \\n\",\"like a poor man's you can count on me\\n\",\"louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . \\n\",\"blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . \\n\",\"scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . \\n\",\"a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . \\n\",\"the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . \\n\",\"the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . \\n\",\"one thing's for sure\\u0097if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . \\n\",\"makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . \\n\",\"bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . \\n\",\"the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . \\n\",\" . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . \\n\",\" . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . \\n\",\"could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . \\n\",\"you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . \\n\",\"at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it\\n\",\"mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . \\n\",\"its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . \\n\",\"constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . \\n\",\"its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . \\n\",\"a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to

and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . \\n\",\"the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get :

meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . \\n\",\"led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . \\n\",\"the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . \\n\",\"a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . \\n\",\"it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . \\n\",\"extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake

intriguing wrinkles . \\n\",\"it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . \\n\",\"lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . \\n\",\"the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . \\n\",\"the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . \\n\",\"if you've the patience , there are great rewards here . \\n\",\"a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . \\n\",\"so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . \\n\",\"thanks to the ch\\u00e2teau's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . \\n\",\"it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . \\n\",\"this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . \\n\",\"without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . \\n\",\"sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments . \\n\",\"the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . \\n\",\"the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . \\n\",\"while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying . think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind . \\n\",\"there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . \\n\",\"the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . \\n\",\"about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . \\n\",\"if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . \\n\",\"it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . \\n\",\"it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again

\\n\",\"as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . \\n\",\"about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . \\n\",\"[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . \\n\",\"together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . \\n\",\"anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . \\n\",\"so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . \\n\",\"a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . \\n\",\"often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .

years . \\n\",\"deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . \\n\",\"a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . \\n\",\"on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . \\n\",\"crummy\\n\",\"well , it does go on forever . \\n\",\"a generic international version of a typical american horror film . \\n\",\"i can't

story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . \\n\",\"cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense

\\n\",\"there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . \\n\",\"as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . \\n\",\"starts off witty and

. \\n\",\"spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . \\n\",\"the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . \\n\",\"the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . \\n\",\"one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . \\n\",\"when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or

coming-of-age drama . \\n\",\"the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . \\n\",\"a sharp and

american pie-like irreverence . \\n\",\"an unflinching look at the world's dispossessed . \\n\",\"the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . \\n\",\"the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . \\n\",\"shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . \\n\",\"not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . \\n\",\"an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . \\n\",\"sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . \\n\",\"the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . \\n\",\"there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . \\n\",\"the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . \\n\",\"though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . \\n\",\"it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . \\n\",\"a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . \\n\",\"there's plenty to impress about e . t . \\n\",\"a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow . \\n\",\"harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . \\n\",\"a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . \\n\",\"the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . \\n\",\"loud , silly , stupid and pointless . \\n\",\"well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . \\n\",\"it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . \\n\",\"it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . \\n\",\"the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . \\n\",\"accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . \\n\",\"in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . \\n\",\"loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . \\n\",\"the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . \\n\",\"an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . \\n\",\" . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . \\n\",\"has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a

piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . \\n\",\" . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . \\n\",\"because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . \\n\",\"the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . \\n\",\"it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . \\n\",\"elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . \\n\",\"if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . \\n\",\"[sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . \\n\",\"while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . \\n\",\"it's everything you don't go to the movies for . \\n\",\"if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . \\n\",\"evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's \\\" house of games \\\" and last fall's \\\" heist \\\" so much fun . \\n\",\"verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . \\n\",\"a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . \\n\",\"although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . \\n\",\"morvern rocks . \\n\",\"every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . \\n\",\"it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . \\n\",\"director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . \\n\",\" . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . \\n\",\"opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . \\n\",\"a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . \\n\",\"a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . \\n\",\"this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . \\n\",\"there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . \\n\",\" . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . \\n\",\"one of those so-so films that could have been much better . \\n\",\"it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . \\n\",\"there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . \\n\",\"don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . \\n\",\"much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . \\n\",\"renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . \\n\",\"the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . \\n\",\"borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . \\n\",\"one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . \\n\",\"this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . \\n\",\"fairly run-of-the-mill . \\n\",\"harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . \\n\",\"just what makes us happy , anyway ? \\n\",\"maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again . \\n\",\"fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . \\n\",\"the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . \\n\",\"enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . \\n\",\"wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . \\n\",\"el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . \\n\",\"wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your

well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . \\n\",\"an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema . \\n\",\"' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '\\n\",\"candid camera on methamphetamines . \\n\",\"an exhilarating experience . \\n\",\"for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . \\n\",\"zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . \\n\",\"the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . \\n\",\"scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . \\n\",\"guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . \\n\",\" the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . \\n\",\"there's a lot to recommend read my lips . \\n\",\"splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . \\n\",\"there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . \\n\",\"godawful boring slug of a movie . \\n\",\"that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . \\n\",\"entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . \\n\",\"in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand . his work with actors is particularly impressive . \\n\",\"metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . \\n\",\"the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . \\n\",\"this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . \\n\",\"real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . \\n\",\"hey , who else needs a shower ? \\n\",\"veret\\u00e9 has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . \\n\",\"american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . \\n\",\"no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . \\n\",\"may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . \\n\",\"not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . \\n\",\"director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . \\n\",\"a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . \\n\",\"human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . \\n\",\"the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 and arbitrary flashbacks . \\n\",\"once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't , either . \\n\",\"christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . \\n\",\"such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . \\n\",\"has none of the crackle of \\\" fatal attraction \\\" , \\\" 9 \\u00bd weeks \\\" , or even \\\" indecent proposal \\\" , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of \\\" lolita \\\" . \\n\",\"a gushy episode of \\\" m * a * s * h \\\" only this time from an asian perspective . \\n\",\"even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth . \\n\",\"candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . \\n\",\"an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . \\n\",\"statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . \\n\",\"stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . \\n\",\"a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . \\n\",\"never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . \\n\",\"though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . \\n\",\"a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . \\n\",\"the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . \\n\",\"apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . \\n\",\"perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . \\n\",\"while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . \\n\",\"an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . \\n\",\"the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . \\n\",\"contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . \\n\",\"a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . \\n\",\"take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . \\n\",\"deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . \\n\",\"a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . \\n\",\"it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . \\n\",\"this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . \\n\",\"when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best\\n\",\"bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . \\n\",\"it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . \\n\",\"lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . \\n\",\"this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . \\n\",\"a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . \\n\",\"sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . \\n\",\"fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . \\n\",\"kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .

claustrophobic minutes . \\n\",\"largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . \\n\",\"the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich\\u00e9s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times\\n\",\"the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine .

the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . \\n\",\"an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order\\n\",\"content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . \\n\",\"well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . \\n\",\"a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . \\n\",\"few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . \\n\",\"amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . \\n\",\"a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry

photography and surfing . \\n\",\"i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . \\n\",\"it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . \\n\",\"feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . \\n\",\"consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . \\n\",\"this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy

spirit soars every bit as high . \\n\",\"it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . \\n\",\"proves that some movie formulas don't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie . \\n\",\"streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , \\\" big trouble \\\" is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . \\n\",\"part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . \\n\",\"exciting documentary . \\n\",\"the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . \\n\",\"it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . \\n\",\"forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . \\n\",\"you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . \\n\",\"reinforces the often forgotten

be white-knuckled and unable to look away . \\n\",\"though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . \\n\",\"kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . \\n\",\"much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich\\u00e9 . \\n\",\"such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . \\n\",\"if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . \\n\",\"japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . \\n\",\"it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . \\n\",\"[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . \\n\",\"the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . \\n\",\" \\\" looking for leonard \\\" just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . \\n\",\"filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far

several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . \\n\",\"told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject

baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . \\n\",\" . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . \\n\",\"the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . \\n\",\"the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . \\n\",\"in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . \\n\",\"outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . \\n\",\"lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . \\n\",\"this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . \\n\",\"a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . \\n\",\"the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . \\n\",\"may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . \\n\",\"aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom

of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . \\n\",\"nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . \\n\",\"a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . \\n\",\"the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . \\n\",\"at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . \\n\",\"huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . \\n\",\"diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . \\n\",\"miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . \\n\",\"the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . \\n\",\"cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the

acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . \\n\",\"[a] rare , beautiful film . \\n\",\"overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . \\n\",\"solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . \\n\",\"it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . \\n\",\"if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . \\n\",\"a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation . \\n\",\"highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which

. \\n\",\"cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . \\n\",\"in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . \\n\",\"ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .

credibility flies out the window . \\n\",\"a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . \\n\",\"witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . \\n\",\"in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . \\n\",\"instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . \\n\",\"it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . \\n\",\"dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . \\n\",\"i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . \\n\",\"witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . \\n\",\"the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . \\n\",\"well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . \\n\",\"a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . \\n\",\" an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . \\n\",\"as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . \\n\",\"a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . \\n\",\"schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . \\n\",\" . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . \\n\",\"this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . \\n\",\"a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . \\n\",\"it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! \\n\",\"suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . \\n\",\"build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst --

in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . \\n\",\"though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . \\n\",\"the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so

comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . \\n\",\"you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . \\n\",\"the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . \\n\",\"this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . \\n\",\"an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . \\n\",\"it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . \\n\",\"a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . \\n\",\"the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . \\n\",\"though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . \\n\",\"rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . \\n\",\"cusack's just brilliant in this . \\n\",\"the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . \\n\",\"hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . \\n\",\"flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . \\n\",\"the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . \\n\",\"it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . \\n\",\"given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the

wry dark humor . \\n\",\"if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life , eisenstein delivers . \\n\",\"if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of \\\" the isle \\\" you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere

faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . \\n\",\"a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . \\n\",\"that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . \\n\",\"blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's

the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . \\n\",\"a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . \\n\",\"i highly recommend irwin , but not in

gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? \\n\",\"the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . \\n\",\"the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '\\n\",\"like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . \\n\",\"like the

from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . \\n\",\"a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone

strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . \\n\",\"this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . \\n\",\"if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . \\n\",\"this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . \\n\",\"a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird

this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . \\n\",\"if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . \\n\",\"nothing about this movie works . \\n\",\"at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . \\n\",\"its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . \\n\",\"brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . \\n\",\"the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . \\n\",\"it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . \\n\",\"murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . \\n\",\"what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . \\n\",\"as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . \\n\",\"nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit . \\n\",\"more of

the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . \\n\",\"however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . \\n\",\"as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . \\n\",\"a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . \\n\",\"the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . \\n\",\"the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . \\n\",\"this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . \\n\",\"they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . \\n\",\"hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . \\n\",\"even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . \\n\",\"stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a \\\" true story \\\" and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . \\n\",\"so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . \\n\",\"the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . \\n\",\"all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . \\n\",\" \\\" me without you \\\" is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . \\n\",\"the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . \\n\",\"best described as i know what you did last winter . \\n\",\"although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . \\n\",\"jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . \\n\",\"seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . \\n\",\"life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . \\n\",\"since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . \\n\",\"rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . \\n\",\"laughably , irredeemably awful . \\n\",\"a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . \\n\",\"pray has really done his subject

companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . \\n\",\"this is no \\\" waterboy ! \\\" \\n\",\"while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . \\n\",\"van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . \\n\",\"if \\\" lilo & stitch \\\" isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since \\\" dumbo \\\" certainly ranks as the most original in years . \\n\",\"it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . \\n\",\"the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . \\n\",\"it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . \\n\",\"scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . \\n\",\"sweet home alabama \\\" is what it is \\u0096 a nice , harmless date film . . . \\n\",\"it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . \\n\",\"if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . \\n\",\"the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but   in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has \\u0096 ironically - distanced us from the characters . \\n\",\"here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . \\n\",\"a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . \\n\",\"guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients ,

achieves a mesmerizing poetry . \\n\",\"it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . \\n\",\"plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . \\n\",\"a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . \\n\",\"call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . \\n\",\"mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . \\n\",\"viewers of \\\" the ring \\\" are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . \\n\",\"same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . \\n\",\"it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . \\n\",\"there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit

\\n\",\"fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . \\n\",\"it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . \\n\",\"lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . \\n\",\"a noble failure . \\n\",\"robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . \\n\",\"is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? \\n\",\"though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . \\n\",\"an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . \\n\",\"when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . \\n\",\"smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . \\n\",\"grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . \\n\",\"nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . \\n\",\"with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . \\n\",\"his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . \\n\",\"quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? \\n\",\"a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . \\n\",\"this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . \\n\",\"mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . \\n\",\"shrewd but pointless . \\n\",\"a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . \\n\",\"not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . \\n\",\"it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . \\n\",\"one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . \\n\",\"a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . \\n\",\"the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . \\n\",\"surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . \\n\",\"after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . \\n\",\"the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . \\n\",\"'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . \\n\",\"murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . \\n\",\"[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . \\n\",\"a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . \\n\",\"if a few good men told us that we \\\" can't handle the truth \\\" than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we \\\" don't care about the truth . \\\" \\n\",\"the film oozes craft . \\n\",\"kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . \\n\",\"like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . \\n\",\"that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . \\n\",\"demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . \\n\",\"a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . \\n\",\"will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . \\n\",\"an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . \\n\",\"this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of am\\u00e9lie . \\n\",\"to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . \\n\",\"howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a bu\\u00f1uel retrospective . \\n\",\"michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . \\n\",\"you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . \\n\",\"the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . \\n\",\"dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . \\n\",\"no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . \\n\",\"[westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . \\n\",\"a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . \\n\",\"yet another weepy southern bore-athon . \\n\",\"kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . \\n\",\"a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . \\n\",\"enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . \\n\",\"a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . \\n\",\"l\\u00e1stima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . \\n\",\"angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . \\n\",\"not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . \\n\",\"devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . \\n\",\"plays like some corny television production from a bygone era\\n\",\"for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . \\n\",\"it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . \\n\",\"sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . \\n\",\"jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . \\n\",\"a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . \\n\",\"in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . \\n\",\"george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . \\n\",\"weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . \\n\",\"leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . \\n\",\"where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . \\n\",\"stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . \\n\",\"brisk hack job . \\n\",\"long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . \\n\",\"a french film with a more down-home flavor . \\n\",\"flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . \\n\",\"like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly \\\" unfilmable \\\" novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . \\n\",\"sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . \\n\",\"it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . \\n\",\"director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . \\n\",\"woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . \\n\",\"a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . \\n\",\"diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . \\n\",\"a comic gem with some serious sparkles . \\n\",\" \\\" the quiet american \\\" begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble . \\n\",\"all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . \\n\",\"a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . \\n\",\"perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . \\n\",\"if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . \\n\",\"uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . \\n\",\"a dreary indulgence . \\n\",\"the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . \\n\",\"this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . \\n\",\"admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . \\n\",\"even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . \\n\",\"any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . \\n\",\"satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . \\n\",\"diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . \\n\",\"a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . \\n\",\"this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . \\n\",\"almost peerlessly unsettling . \\n\",\"over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . \\n\",\"it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . \\n\",\"the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . \\n\",\"a quiet , disquieting triumph . \\n\",\"very stupid and annoying . \\n\",\"at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . \\n\",\"a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '\\n\",\"offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . \\n\",\"there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . \\n\",\"the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality . \\n\",\"if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . \\n\",\"the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . \\n\",\"the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . \\n\",\"exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . \\n\",\"the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . \\n\",\"it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . \\n\",\"a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad . \\n\",\"nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . \\n\",\"i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . \\n\",\"occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . \\n\",\"you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . \\n\",\"a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . \\n\",\"it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . \\n\",\"when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . \\n\",\"the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle ,

appealing . \\n\",\"a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . \\n\",\"no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . \\n\",\"plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . \\n\",\"sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar

\\n\",\"an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . \\n\",\"pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the

laziest . \\n\",\"daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . \\n\",\"the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? \\n\",\"i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for

death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . \\n\",\"here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . \\n\",\"whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . \\n\",\"the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that

absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . \\n\",\" . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . \\n\",\"proves a servicable world war ii drama that

screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . \\n\",\"in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . \\n\",\"the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . \\n\",\"this is a movie so insecure about

journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her . \\n\",\"ultimately , the message of

stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . \\n\",\"not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . \\n\",\"an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or

fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . \\n\",\"a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . \\n\",\" . . . a pretentious mess . . . \\n\",\"this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . \\n\",\"the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . \\n\",\"almost gags on its own gore . \\n\",\"the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . \\n\",\"scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . \\n\",\"quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . \\n\",\"while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . \\n\",\"sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . \\n\",\"it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . \\n\",\"all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . \\n\",\"a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . \\n\",\"spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . \\n\",\"i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . \\n\",\"this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . \\n\",\"will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . \\n\",\"the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . \\n\",\"liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . \\n\",\"it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . \\n\",\"surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . \\n\",\"while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . \\n\",\"seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . \\n\",\"adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . \\n\",\"[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . \\n\",\"dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted\\n\",\"it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . \\n\",\"full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . \\n\",\"[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . \\n\",\"piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . \\n\",\"an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . \\n\",\"has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . \\n\",\"imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . \\n\",\"the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . \\n\",\"let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly \\\" inspired \\\" was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . \\n\",\"there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . \\n\",\"claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . \\n\",\"the ch\\u00e2teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . \\n\",\"[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point \\u0096 even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . \\n\",\"i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . \\n\",\"the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . \\n\",\"what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . \\n\",\"just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . \\n\",\"the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . \\n\",\"with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . \\n\",\"only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . \\n\",\"although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . \\n\",\"a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . \\n\",\"carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . \\n\",\"die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . \\n\",\"has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . \\n\",\"japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . \\n\",\"what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . \\n\",\"boisterous and daft documentary . \\n\",\" \\\" on guard ! \\\" won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . \\n\",\"a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . \\n\",\"hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . \\n\",\"ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . \\n\",\"the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . \\n\",\"even better than the first one ! \\n\",\"the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . \\n\",\"the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . \\n\",\"nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . \\n\",\"waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . \\n\",\"as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . \\n\",\"the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . \\n\",\"it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . \\n\",\"never comes together as a coherent whole . \\n\",\"the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . \\n\",\" with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . \\n\",\"it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . \\n\",\"technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . \\n\",\"the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . \\n\",\"there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . \\n\",\"stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . \\n\",\"though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone . \\n\",\"everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . \\n\",\"a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . \\n\",\"there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . \\n\",\"executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . \\n\",\"even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . \\n\",\"you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . \\n\",\"a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . \\n\",\"what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . \\n\",\"the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . \\n\",\"the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . \\n\",\"just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . \\n\",\"seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . \\n\",\"see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . \\n\",\"feeble comedy . \\n\",\"lame , haphazard teen comedy . \\n\",\"what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . \\n\",\"a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . \\n\",\"new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . \\n\",\"the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . \\n\",\"the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . \\n\",\"an intoxicating experience . \\n\",\"the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . \\n\",\"for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . \\n\",\"[ \\\" take care of my cat \\\" ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . \\n\",\"michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . \\n\",\"if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be \\\" how does steven seagal come across these days ? \\\" or maybe \\\" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? \\n\",\"wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . \\n\",\"this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . \\n\",\"deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . \\n\",\"moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . \\n\",\"too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . \\n\",\"a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . \\n\",\"though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . \\n\",\"written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . \\n\",\"writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . \\n\",\"sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . \\n\",\"mildly amusing . \\n\",\"the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . \\n\",\"lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . \\n\",\"a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . \\n\",\"the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . \\n\",\"the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . \\n\",\"it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . \\n\",\"the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . \\n\",\"majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . \\n\",\"millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . \\n\",\"this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . \\n\",\" .

to have it all go wrong . \\n\",\"a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . \\n\",\"you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . \\n\",\"one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . \\n\",\"as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . \\n\",\"beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . \\n\",\"more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . \\n\",\"as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . \\n\",\"it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . \\n\",\"avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . \\n\",\"an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . \\n\",\"it is a comedy that's not very

\\n\",\"charming , if overly complicated . . . \\n\",\"the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . \\n\",\"do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? \\n\",\"binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . \\n\",\"a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . \\n\",\"what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . \\n\",\"stay away . far away . \\n\",\"no surprises . \\n\",\"stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens . \\n\",\"an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . \\n\",\"a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . \\n\",\"there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . \\n\",\"kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to

combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . \\n\",\"call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . \\n\",\"the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . \\n\",\"a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . \\n\",\"a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . \\n\",\"murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . \\n\",\"now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . \\n\",\"'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit\\n\",\"does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? \\n\",\"the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . \\n\",\"grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . \\n\",\"tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . \\n\",\"maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . \\n\",\"a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy . \\n\",\"labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . \\n\",\"stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . \\n\",\"the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . \\n\",\"it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . \\n\",\"it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . \\n\",\"not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . \\n\",\"if you love reading and/or poetry , then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it . \\n\",\"the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . \\n\",\"just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . \\n\",\"i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . \\n\",\"originality is sorely lacking . \\n\",\"while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . \\n\",\"it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . \\n\",\"there's . . . an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm . \\n\",\"it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . \\n\",\"a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . \\n\",\"rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . \\n\",\"one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . \\n\",\"`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . \\n\",\"a well-put-together piece of urban satire . \\n\",\"this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . \\n\",\"this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . \\n\",\"to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . \\n\",\"[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic

with calamity . \\n\",\"if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . \\n\",\"love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . \\n\",\"boring and meandering . \\n\",\"a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . \\n\",\"this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . \\n\",\"a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . \\n\",\"this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who

\\n\",\"directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . \\n\",\"this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids .

understanding . \\n\",\"the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . \\n\",\"the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this

natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . \\n\",\"successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . \\n\",\"its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the

rainwear . \\n\",\"it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . \\n\",\"a solid , psychological action film from hong kong . \\n\",\"though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . \\n\",\"as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . \\n\",\"peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . \\n\",\"the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . \\n\",\"how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . \\n\",\"completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . \\n\",\"light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically . \\n\",\"like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . \\n\",\"the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . \\n\",\" . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . \\n\",\"presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . \\n\",\"the film is delicately narrated by martin

effectiveness . \\n\",\"at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . \\n\",\"clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . \\n\",\"if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . \\n\",\"never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . \\n\",\"it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . \\n\",\"cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . \\n\",\"as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . \\n\",\"takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . \\n\",\"it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . \\n\",\"as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . \\n\",\"everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . \\n\",\"unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . \\n\",\"an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . \\n\",\"a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . \\n\",\"a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . \\n\",\"plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . \\n\",\" . . . quite endearing . \\n\",\"nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . \\n\",\"as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . \\n\",\"we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . \\n\",\"imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . \\n\",\"devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . \\n\",\"the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . \\n\",\"the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . \\n\",\"like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . \\n\",\"it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . \\n\",\"with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . \\n\",\"i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . \\n\",\"as unseemly as its title suggests . \\n\",\"a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . \\n\",\"one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . \\n\",\"one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . \\n\",\"in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . \\n\",\"in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . \\n\",\"a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . \\n\",\"this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . \\n\",\"it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . \\n\",\"the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . \\n\",\"this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . \\n\",\"bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . \\n\",\"this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . \\n\",\"watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . \\n\",\"a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . \\n\",\"interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . \\n\",\"it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . \\n\",\"the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if \\\" gory mayhem \\\" is your idea of a good time . \\n\",\"the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . \\n\",\"maybe leblanc thought , \\\" hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . \\\" \\n\",\"the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . \\n\",\"all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . \\n\",\"absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . \\n\",\"there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . \\n\",\"a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . \\n\",\"what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight\\n\",\"it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . \\n\",\"director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . \\n\",\"this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . \\n\",\"maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . \\n\",\"gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . \\n\",\"the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . \\n\",\"[a] stuporously solemn film . \\n\",\"few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . \\n\",\"probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . \\n\",\"although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . \\n\",\"would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? \\n\",\"a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . \\n\",\"strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . \\n\",\"this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . \\n\",\"a solidly entertaining little film . \\n\",\"instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . \\n\",\"woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . \\n\",\"the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . \\n\",\"a clever blend of fact and fiction . \\n\",\"a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . \\n\",\"as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . \\n\",\"the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . \\n\",\"it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . \\n\",\"pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . \\n\",\"equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . \\n\",\"a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . \\n\",\"there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . \\n\",\"worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . \\n\",\"the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . \\n\",\"if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . \\n\",\"there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . \\n\",\"the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . \\n\",\"not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . \\n\",\"a must see for all sides of the political spectrum\\n\",\"filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . \\n\",\"interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . \\n\",\"a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . \\n\",\"it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting . \\n\",\"hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . \\n\",\" . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . \\n\",\"beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . \\n\",\"[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . \\n\",\"[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . \\n\",\"noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . \\n\",\"degenerates into hogwash . \\n\",\"much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . \\n\",\"as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy ,

\\n\",\"blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . \\n\",\"the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . \\n\",\"with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . \\n\",\"one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever . \\n\",\"the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . \\n\",\"there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . \\n\",\"some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . \\n\",\"tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .

equivalent of a chick flick . \\n\",\"the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . \\n\",\" . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a \\\" what was it all for ? \\\" feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . \\n\",\"the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . \\n\",\"parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . \\n\",\"comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . \\n\",\" . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . \\n\",\"a movie to forget\\n\",\"there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . \\n\",\"whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . \\n\",\"the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . \\n\",\"although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . \\n\",\"an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . \\n\",\"it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . \\n\",\"chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . \\n\",\"deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added

only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . \\n\",\"with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone\\n\",\"it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . \\n\",\"death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . \\n\",\"starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but

casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . \\n\",\"it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . \\n\",\"this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . \\n\",\"the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . \\n\",\"leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . \\n\",\"the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . \\n\",\"a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . \\n\",\"the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . \\n\",\"with exquisite

endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . \\n\",\"a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . \\n\",\"your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film . \\n\",\"it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . \\n\",\" . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . \\n\",\"the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . \\n\",\"when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? \\n\",\"a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . \\n\",\"too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . \\n\",\"has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . \\n\",\"blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . \\n\",\"the master of disguise is funny--not \\\" ha ha \\\"

called \\\" jar-jar binks : the movie . \\\" it's that painful . \\n\",\"a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . \\n\",\"ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . \\n\",\"enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . \\n\",\"any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . \\n\",\" . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie\\n\",\"a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . \\n\",\"poetic , heartbreaking . \\n\",\"although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . \\n\",\"the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . \\n\",\"[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . \\n\",\"schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . \\n\",\"it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : \\\" got aids yet ? \\\" \\n\",\"a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . \\n\",\"even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . \\n\",\"this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . \\n\",\"it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . \\n\",\"there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . \\n\",\"barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . \\n\",\"for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience\\n\",\"true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . \\n\",\"a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . \\n\",\"while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious . \\n\",\"the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . \\n\",\"oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough\\n\",\"this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . \\n\",\"one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . \\n\",\"an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . \\n\",\"a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . \\n\",\"fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . \\n\",\"the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes\\n\",\"a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan jos\\u00e9 campanella's reputation in the united states . \\n\",\"i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . \\n\",\"a fun ride . \\n\",\"it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . \\n\",\"though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . \\n\",\"how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [fran\\u00e7ois and mich\\u00e8le's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . \\n\",\"jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . \\n\",\"aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . \\n\",\"the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . \\n\",\"you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . \\n\",\"'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '\\n\",\"smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . \\n\",\"alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . \\n\",\"an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy\\n\",\"the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . \\n\",\"it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so\\n\",\"the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . \\n\",\"bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . \\n\",\"excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . \\n\",\"a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . \\n\",\"'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . \\n\",\"what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . \\n\",\"like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . \\n\",\"with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry . \\n\",\"with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises . \\n\",\"jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . \\n\",\"frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . \\n\",\"it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout . \\n\",\"saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . \\n\",\"each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . \\n\",\"about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . \\n\",\" \\\" the best disney movie since the lion king \\\" \\n\",\"high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . \\n\",\"you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . \\n\",\"like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . \\n\",\"drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . \\n\",\"it drowns in sap . \\n\",\"a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . \\n\",\"good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . \\n\",\"the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . \\n\",\"no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . \\n\",\"the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . \\n\",\"i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . \\n\",\"es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprender\\u00e1 . \\n\",\"even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . \\n\",\"most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven

fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . \\n\",\"a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . \\n\",\"tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . \\n\",\"the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . \\n\",\"helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . \\n\",\"shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . \\n\",\"it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . \\n\",\"the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . \\n\",\"i walked away not really know who \\\" they \\\" were , what \\\" they \\\" looked like . why \\\" they \\\" were here and what \\\" they \\\" wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . \\n\",\"the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . \\n\",\"fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . \\n\",\"it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . \\n\",\"borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . \\n\",\"despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . \\n\",\"the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . \\n\",\"the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . \\n\",\"more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . \\n\",\"what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! \\n\",\"an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . \\n\",\"a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . \\n\",\"the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . \\n\",\"it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . \\n\",\"while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story . \\n\",\"everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . \\n\",\"a sometimes tedious film . \\n\",\"each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . \\n\",\"promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . \\n\",\"not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . \\n\",\"not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . \\n\",\"the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . \\n\",\"one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . \\n\",\"there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . \\\" the adventures of pluto nash \\\" is a big time stinker . \\n\",\"it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . \\n\",\"skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . \\n\",\"feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . \\n\",\"a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . \\n\",\"ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . \\n\",\"wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . \\n\",\"a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . \\n\",\"'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '\\n\",\"serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . \\n\",\"told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . \\n\",\"sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . \\n\",\"an opportunity missed . \\n\",\"a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . \\n\",\"with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . \\n\",\"the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in . \\n\",\"barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . \\n\",\"it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . \\n\",\"in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . \\n\",\"it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . \\n\",\"it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . \\n\",\"this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . \\n\",\"the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . \\n\",\"what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . \\n\",\"a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . \\n\",\"a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . \\n\",\"if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone . \\n\",\"the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . \\n\",\"it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . \\n\",\"what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? \\n\",\"a gripping drama . \\n\",\"insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . \\n\",\"a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . \\n\",\"it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . \\n\",\"the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . \\n\",\"it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . \\n\",\"it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . \\n\",\"a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . \\n\",\"merci pour le movie . \\n\",\"the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . \\n\",\"will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . \\n\",\"despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . \\n\",\"fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . \\n\",\"with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . \\n\",\"there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . \\n\",\"may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . \\n\",\"fun and nimble . \\n\",\" . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . \\n\",\"enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . \\n\",\"it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . \\n\",\"amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . \\n\",\" . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . \\n\",\"sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . \\n\",\" a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . \\n\",\"'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent .

exhilarating movie a great yarn . \\n\",\"red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . \\n\",\"even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own

sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . \\n\",\"tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . \\n\",\"it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . \\n\",\"i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits\\n\",\"[i]t's

manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . \\n\",\"it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store

\\n\",\"painfully padded . \\n\",\"the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . \\n\",\"an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . \\n\",\"because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . \\n\",\"an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . \\n\",\"it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . \\n\",\"a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . \\n\",\"nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation

of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg's misunderstood career . \\n\",\"most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . \\n\",\"the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . \\n\",\"a lovely film for the holiday season . \\n\",\"george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . \\n\",\"dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then

with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . \\n\",\"broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . \\n\",\"no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . \\n\",\"the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . \\n\",\"directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . \\n\",\"the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . \\n\",\"not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . \\n\",\"at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . \\n\",\"a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . \\n\",\"unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . \\n\",\"it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '\\n\",\"remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . \\n\",\"this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . \\n\",\"a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . \\n\",\"the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . \\n\",\"highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . \\n\",\"the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . \\n\",\"thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . \\n\",\"a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . \\n\",\"it may not be history \\u0096 but then again , what if it is ? \\u0096 but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . \\n\",\"an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . \\n\",\"the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . \\n\",\"though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . \\n\",\"the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . \\n\",\"the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . \\n\",\"this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . \\n\",\"a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage \\\" be careful what you wish for \\\" is given a full workout . \\n\",\"chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . \\n\",\"as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant !

roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . \\n\",\"in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . \\n\",\"it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . \\n\",\"the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . \\n\",\"the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . \\n\",\"spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . \\n\",\"a portrait of an artist . \\n\",\"this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . \\n\",\"you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . \\n\",\"an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . \\n\",\"frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . \\n\",\"the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . \\n\",\"for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words \\\" radical \\\" or \\\" suck \\\" into a sentence . \\n\",\"the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . \\n\",\"nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . \\n\",\"it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . \\n\",\" \\\" juwanna mann ? \\\" no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . \\n\",\"a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . \\n\",\"a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . \\n\",\"jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . \\n\",\"a very funny movie . \\n\",\"a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . \\n\",\"thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . \\n\",\"it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . \\n\",\"director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . \\n\",\"sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? \\n\",\"young

whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . \\n\",\"if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . \\n\",\"the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these

-- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- \\\" cherish \\\" certainly isn't dull . \\n\",\"pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . \\n\",\"there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . \\n\",\"an hour and a half of joyful solo performance . \\n\",\"nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . \\n\",\"remarkably accessible and affecting . \\n\",\"the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . \\n\",\"a complete waste of time

\\n\",\"insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all

\\n\",\"this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . \\n\",\"a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . \\n\",\"ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . \\n\",\"when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . \\n\",\"hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . \\n\",\" . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . \\n\",\"a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . \\n\",\"the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . \\n\",\"[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . \\n\",\"neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . \\n\",\"de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . \\n\",\"strange it is , but delightfully so . \\n\",\"300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . \\n\",\"the most consistently funny of the austin

three films . \\n\",\"a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . \\n\",\" . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . \\n\",\"the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . \\n\",\"sweetly sexy ,

of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . \\n\",\"a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . \\n\",\"george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . \\n\",\"if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . \\n\",\"in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . \\n\",\"what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion . \\n\",\"an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . \\n\",\"passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . \\n\",\"enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . \\n\",\"falls short in explaining the music and its roots . \\n\",\"pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . \\n\",\"even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . \\n\",\"it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . \\n\",\"its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . \\n\",\"mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . \\n\",\"aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . \\n\",\"witty , vibrant , and intelligent . \\n\",\"it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . \\n\",\"unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . \\n\",\"a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . \\n\",\"a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . \\n\",\"a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . \\n\",\"seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . \\n\",\"although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . \\n\",\"melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . \\n\",\"the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . \\n\",\"witty , touching and well paced . \\n\",\"a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . \\n\",\" . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . \\n\",\"the central story lacks punch . \\n\",\"director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . \\n\",\"this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! \\n\",\"a picture as erratic as its central character . \\n\",\"not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '\\n\",\"it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . \\n\",\"significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . \\n\",\"if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . \\n\",\"this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . \\n\",\"the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . \\n\",\"what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . \\n\",\"an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach\\n\",\"the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . \\n\",\"the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . \\n\",\"if jews were catholics , this would be catechism\\n\",\"a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . \\n\",\"ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . \\n\",\"michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . \\n\",\"a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . \\n\",\"[moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . \\n\",\"all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . \\n\",\"it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . \\n\",\"despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . \\n\",\"due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . \\n\",\"compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . \\n\",\"seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . \\n\",\"the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . \\n\",\"now i can see why people thought i was too hard on \\\" the mothman prophecies \\\" . \\n\",\"a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . \\n\",\" . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . \\n\",\"a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . \\n\",\"one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . \\n\",\"an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . \\n\",\"[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . \\n\",\"there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . \\n\",\"at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . \\n\",\"some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . \\n\",\"though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . \\n\",\"for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . \\n\",\"for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . \\n\",\"one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . \\n\",\"dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit\\n\",\"all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . \\n\",\"collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . \\n\",\"rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . \\n\",\"even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . \\n\",\"a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . \\n\",\" . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games . \\n\",\"you can practically smell the patchouli oil . \\n\",\"dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . \\n\",\"the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . \\n\",\"what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . \\n\",\"the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . \\n\",\"it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing\\n\",\"hollywood ending just isn't very funny . \\n\",\"director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . \\n\",\"it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . \\n\",\"oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material\\n\",\"director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . \\n\",\"a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . \\n\",\"spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are . \\n\",\"a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . \\n\",\"my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . \\n\",\"depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . \\n\",\"the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . \\n\",\"broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . \\n\",\"falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . \\n\",\"it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . \\n\",\"because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . \\n\",\"this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater\\n\",\"old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . \\n\",\"the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . \\n\",\"this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . \\n\",\"far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . \\n\",\"the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . \\n\",\"the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . \\n\",\"on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . \\n\",\"don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . \\n\",\"the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . \\n\",\"there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . \\n\",\" . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . \\n\",\"the film is flat . \\n\",\"unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . \\n\",\"while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . \\n\",\"at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli . \\n\",\"sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . \\n\",\"[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . \\n\",\"[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . \\n\",\"it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . \\n\",\"while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . \\n\",\"a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted . \\n\",\"sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . \\n\",\"there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . \\n\",\"the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . \\n\",\"although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . \\n\",\"may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . \\n\",\"the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . \\n\",\"a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . \\n\",\"this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . \\n\",\"it's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . \\n\",\"the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . \\n\",\"an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . \\n\",\"[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . \\n\",\"beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . \\n\",\"the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . \\n\",\"turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts\\n\",\"though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . \\n\",\"reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . \\n\",\"it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . \\n\",\"a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . \\n\",\"unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . \\n\",\"while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . \\n\",\"there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . \\n\",\"mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . \\n\",\"when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . \\n\",\"the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . \\n\",\"the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . \\n\",\"this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . \\n\",\"in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . \\n\",\"were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . \\n\",\"a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . \\n\",\"challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . \\n\",\"watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . \\n\",\"a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . \\n\",\" . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . \\n\",\"elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . \\n\",\"charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . \\n\",\"it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . \\n\",\"no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .

\\n\",\"if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . \\n\",\"it's provocative

\\n\",\"it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . \\n\",\"the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . \\n\",\"like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . \\n\",\"a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . \\n\",\"tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . \\n\",\"not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . \\n\",\"o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . \\n\",\"inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . \\n\",\"this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . \\n\",\"it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . \\n\",\"probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . \\n\",\"pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . \\n\",\" . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . \\n\",\"a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . \\n\",\"deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . \\n\",\"the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . \\n\",\"the story has little wit and no surprises . \\n\",\"the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . \\n\",\"exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . \\n\",\"birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . \\n\",\"while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . \\n\",\"the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . \\n\",\"'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . \\n\",\"what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . \\n\",\"most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . \\n\",\"return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad . \\n\",\"it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . \\n\",\"were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre .

\\n\",\"deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises\\n\",\"exciting and well-paced . \\n\",\"a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . \\n\",\"a deep and meaningful film . \\n\",\"an uninspired preachy and clich\\u00e9d war film . \\n\",\"unflinchingly bleak and desperate\\n\",\"plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . \\n\",\"a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . \\n\",\"instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . \\n\",\"the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . \\n\",\"an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . \\n\",\"just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . \\n\",\"all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . \\n\",\"what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . \\n\",\"it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . \\n\",\"watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . \\n\",\"jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema . \\n\",\"miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . \\n\",\"possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . \\n\",\"so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . \\n\",\"it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . \\n\",\"without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . \\n\",\"the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . \\n\",\"a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . \\n\",\"both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . \\n\",\"while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . \\n\",\"only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . \\n\",\"ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? \\n\",\"snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . \\n\",\"mediocre fable from burkina faso . \\n\",\"a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . \\n\",\"it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . \\n\",\"too simple for its own good . \\n\",\"ultimately , \\\" mib ii \\\" succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . \\n\",\"the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . \\n\",\"the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . \\n\",\"the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . \\n\",\"whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . \\n\",\"light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . \\n\",\"there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . \\n\",\"the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . \\n\",\"has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . \\n\",\"anemic , pretentious . \\n\",\"some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . \\n\",\"y tu mam\\u00e1 tambi\\u00e9n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . \\n\",\"the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . \\n\",\"its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . \\n\",\"it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . \\n\",\" . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . \\n\",\"the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . \\n\",\"ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . \\n\",\"confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . \\n\",\"an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . \\n\",\"at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . \\n\",\"good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . \\n\",\"very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in \\\" stuart little 2 \\\" : there's just no story , folks . \\n\",\"paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . \\n\",\"[it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . \\n\",\"fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . \\n\",\"goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse . \\n\",\"[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . \\n\",\"you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . \\n\",\"behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . \\n\",\"i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . \\n\",\"[f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . \\n\",\"it's a treat \\u0096 a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score  grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . \\n\",\"an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . \\n\",\"all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . \\n\",\"if anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . \\n\",\"an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . \\n\",\"a clich\\u00e9d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . \\n\",\"making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . \\n\",\"a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . \\n\",\"a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . \\n\",\"a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . \\n\",\"rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . \\n\",\"a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . \\n\",\"steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches . \\n\",\"for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . \\n\",\"you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . \\n\",\"long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . \\n\",\"without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstr\\u00f6m is just another winter sleepers . \\n\",\"there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . \\n\",\"the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . \\n\",\"amazingly dopey . \\n\",\"an intelligent , moving and invigorating film . \\n\",\"this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . \\n\",\"far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . \\n\",\"has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . \\n\",\"lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . \\n\",\"rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . \\n\",\"secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . \\n\",\"if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? \\n\",\"if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . \\n\",\"parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . \\n\",\"like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . \\n\",\"will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . \\n\",\"instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . \\n\",\"though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . \\n\",\"everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . \\n\",\"made me unintentionally famous \\u0097 as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen . \\n\",\"after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . \\n\",\"for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . \\n\",\"about schmidt belongs to nicholson . gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances . as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance . \\n\",\"a witty , low-key romantic comedy . \\n\",\"ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . \\n\",\"a charming but slight comedy . \\n\",\"in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . \\n\",\"great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . \\n\",\"as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . \\n\",\"sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . \\n\",\"a compelling journey . . . and \\\" his best friend remembers \\\" is up there with the finest of specials . \\n\",\"an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . \\n\",\"there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . \\n\",\"if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . \\n\",\"infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . \\n\",\"full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . \\n\",\"the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . \\n\",\"you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject . \\n\",\"although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless \\u009170s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . \\n\",\"feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . \\n\",\"a taut , intelligent psychological drama . \\n\",\"this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . \\n\",\"a chilling movie without oppressive gore . \\n\",\"as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . \\n\",\"the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . \\n\",\"the best part about \\\" gangs \\\" was daniel day-lewis . \\n\",\"effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . \\n\",\"dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . \\n\",\"i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . \\n\",\"bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . \\n\",\"highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . \\n\",\"though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . \\n\",\"the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . \\n\",\"an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . \\n\",\"terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . \\n\",\"ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . \\n\",\"the komediant is a tale worth catching . \\n\",\"while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . \\n\",\"a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . \\n\",\"with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . \\n\",\"a workshop mentality prevails . \\n\",\"may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . \\n\",\"it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . \\n\",\"with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . \\n\",\"after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich\\u00e9 has been unturned . but no . \\n\",\"the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . \\n\",\"there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . \\n\",\"a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . \\n\",\"there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . \\n\",\"a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . \\n\",\"too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . \\n\",\"the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . \\n\",\"this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . \\n\",\"a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . \\n\",\"astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . \\n\",\"a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . \\n\",\"wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . \\n\",\"apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . \\n\",\"[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . \\n\",\"plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . \\n\",\"confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . \\n\",\"maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . \\n\",\" . . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observaci\\u00f3n de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones . \\n\",\"has a solid emotional impact . \\n\",\"idiotic and ugly . \\n\",\"myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . \\n\",\"leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . \\n\",\"zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure . \\n\",\"i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . \\n\",\"it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . \\n\",\"if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . \\n\",\"ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . \\n\",\"shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . \\n\",\"rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . \\n\",\"a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . \\n\",\"drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . \\n\",\"watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . \\n\",\"slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . \\n\",\"klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . \\n\",\"it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . \\n\",\"the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . \\n\",\"majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . \\n\",\"time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets\\n\",\"russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . \\n\",\"[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . \\n\",\"rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . \\n\",\"there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . \\n\",\"with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . \\n\",\"hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . \\n\",\"like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . \\n\",\"high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast . \\n\",\"the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . \\n\",\"what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . \\n\",\" . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . \\n\",\"i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . \\n\",\"a working class \\\" us vs . them \\\" opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . \\n\",\"with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . \\n\",\"uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . \\n\",\"i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! \\n\",\"everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . \\n\",\"in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . \\n\",\" ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . \\n\",\"if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . \\n\",\"as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . \\n\",\"it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . \\n\",\"an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . \\n\",\"even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . \\n\",\"for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . \\n\",\"the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . \\n\",\"mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . \\n\",\"the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . \\n\",\"if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . \\n\",\"visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . \\n\",\"some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . \\n\",\"the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . \\n\",\"this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . \\n\",\"it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . \\n\",\"the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . \\n\",\"the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . \\n\",\"smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . \\n\",\"a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . \\n\",\"unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . \\n\",\"the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la\\n\",\"ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . \\n\",\"as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . \\n\",\"hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . \\n\",\"examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as wiseman's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers . \\n\",\"definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . \\n\",\"a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . \\n\",\"viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . \\n\",\"if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next . \\n\",\"its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . \\n\",\"a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . \\n\",\"the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . \\n\",\"highly watchable stuff . \\n\",\" . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend \\\" never again . \\\" \\n\",\"a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . \\n\",\"the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . \\n\",\"technically and artistically inept . \\n\",\"earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . \\n\",\"an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . \\n\",\" \\\" the emperor's new clothes \\\" begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . \\n\",\"just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . \\n\",\"just how these families interact may surprise you . \\n\",\"ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . \\n\",\"a conventional but heartwarming tale . \\n\",\"excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . \\n\",\"the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . \\n\",\"gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . \\n\",\"passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . \\n\",\"fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . \\n\",\"the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . \\n\",\"a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . \\n\",\"mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . \\n\",\"the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . \\n\",\"touch\\u00e9 ! \\n\",\"to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . \\n\",\"it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . \\n\",\"truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . \\n\",\"a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . \\n\",\"what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . \\n\",\"this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . \\n\",\"majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . \\n\",\"yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? \\n\",\"the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . \\n\",\"winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . \\n\",\"so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . \\n\",\"what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . \\n\",\"'aunque recurre a ciertos clich\\u00e9s del g\\u00e9nero , la poderosa actuaci\\u00f3n de robin williams perdona las fallas del gui\\u00f3n . '\\n\",\"charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . \\n\",\"tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . \\n\",\"nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . \\n\",\"the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . \\n\",\"a pleasant romantic comedy . \\n\",\"nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . \\n\",\"that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her

two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . \\n\",\"decent but dull . \\n\",\"woefully pretentious . \\n\",\"there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an

somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . \\n\",\"the low-budget
